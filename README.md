## Inspiration💡


As hostel residents 👨🏻‍🦰 ourselves, we understand the challenges you face. 😔 It can be disheartening to go to bed without knowing if there is any food available and where it is located. 🍽️ Additionally, being limited to meals decided by the management might not always align with your preferences, leading to dissatisfaction. 😕 This situation often forces students to spend additional money on meals from outside sources, which can strain their budgets and require careful expense management. 💸


Our project aims to alleviate these difficulties by providing a solution that enables effective communication and transparency between the management and students. 📢🤝 Through features such as polls, notices, and food suggestions, we strive to ensure that you are well-informed about food availability, have a voice in food selection, and can make choices that align with your preferences. 🗳️📋 By enhancing the dining experience and reducing uncertainty, we aim to support your financial well-being 💰 and foster a more inclusive and satisfying food environment within the hostel. 🍽️🏠

## What it Does💪🏫

Our project aims to address the issue of food availability and reduce students' concerns about going to bed with empty stomachs. 🍽️😔 We accomplish this by implementing a polling system where administrators can create polls and students can vote on them. 🗳️👥 Additionally, administrators can post notices on a central notice board indicating which blocks or areas have food availability. 📋🏢 This way, students can easily find information about food availability, eliminating the need for them to wonder and ensuring that no student goes hungry. 🚫🍴😊

In addition to the features mentioned earlier, our project enables students to actively participate in the selection of food options through voting in polls. 🗳️🍕🥗 This empowers them to have a say in the types of food provided on campus. 💪🍽️ Simultaneously, it assists campus management in making informed decisions about food offerings based on student preferences and budget considerations. 💼💰

Furthermore, our system suggests food items that can be prepared using the ingredients available to the management. 🥦🍳🍅 This promotes efficient resource utilization and reduces food waste. ♻️🌱 By leveraging student feedback and optimizing ingredient availability, we create a collaborative approach that enhances the overall dining experience while ensuring cost-effective and sustainable food options. 🍽️👨‍🍳🌍
