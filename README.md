# CampusNourish

**Inspiration**
Our project is inspired by the need to address food insecurity among students and improve the campus dining experience. By bridging communication between campus management and students, we aim to create sustainable food assistance programs and eliminate food insecurity. Our goal is to empower students, revamp campus dining, and ensure their well-being and academic success. Together, we can make a lasting impact on campus communities by fostering inclusivity and providing essential resources for students.

**What it Does**

Our project aims to address the issue of food availability and reduce student's concerns about going to bed with empty stomachs. We accomplish this by implementing a polling system where administrators can create polls and students can vote on them. Additionally, administrators can post notices on a central notice board indicating which blocks or areas have food availability. This way, students can easily find information about food availability, eliminating the need for them to wonder and ensuring that no student goes hungry.
